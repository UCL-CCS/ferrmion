# ferrmion

This codebase contains methods to generate qubit Hamiltonians from fermionic Hamiltonians.


## Encodings 
- Ternary Tree encodings
    Any ternary tree can be generated by adding nodes to a tree structure, and functions exist to easily create standard encodings including: Jordan-Wigner, Parity, Bravyi-Kitaev and JKMN
- k-NTO encodings
    A non-ternary-tree majorana string encoding with the maximal non-trivial overlap possible.
    Only works for systems with even numbers of modes (i.e. all spin-orbit Hamiltonians)


## Implemented Optimizations
- (In Progress) Clifford Heuristic Simulated Annealing


## Development

`uv` is used for depedency management, with `ruff` for linting.
